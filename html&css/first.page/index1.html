<pre class="ff">
	Turtle,<DIV style="background-color: blue;"> (order Testudines)</DIV>, any reptile with a body encased in a bony shell, including tortoises.
	Although numerous animals, from invertebrates to mammals, have evolved shells, none has <SPAN style="background-color: red;">an architecture like </SPAN>that of turtles.
	The turtle shell has a top (carapace) and a bottom (plastron). The carapace and plastron are bony structures that usually join one another along each side of the body, creating a rigid skeletal box.
	This box, composed of bone and cartilage, is retained throughout the turtle’s life. Because the shell is an integral part of the body, the turtle cannot exit it, nor is the shell shed like the skin of some other reptiles.

<p class="rr">Features about turtle</p>
<ol class="ff">
	<li>Turtles belong to one of the oldest reptile groups in the world – beating snakes, crocodiles and alligators!</li> 

<li> These creatures date back to the time of the dinosaurs, over 200 million years ago – woah!</li>

<li>urtles are easily recognised by their bony, cartilaginous shell. This super-tough casing acts like a shield to protect them from predators – some turtles can even tuck their head up inside their shell for extra protection!</li>
